name:                unpacked-maybe
version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            An unpacked maybe data type
description:
  This module is intended to be a drop-in replacement for the Maybe type provided by base. To shave off pointer chasing, it uses '-XUnboxedSums' to represent the Maybe type as two machine words that are contiguous in memory, without loss of expressiveness that Maybe provides.
  .
  This library provides pattern synonyms Just and Nothing that allow users to pattern match on an Unpacked Maybe in the familiar way.
  .
  Functions are also provided for converting an Unpacked Maybe to the base library's Maybe, and vice versa.
  .
  This library is in alpha, and the internals are likely to change.
